## **4️⃣ Upload your notebook**
- Save your Colab notebook as `.ipynb` → `spam_detector.ipynb`.  
- Make sure **all cells run correctly** and include the probability-enhanced `check_email()` function.  

---

## **5️⃣ Optional: Add a small demo**
You can create a small Python script (`demo.py`) to test a few emails quickly:

```python
from spam_detector import check_email

emails = [
    "You won $10,000! Click here to claim your prize.",
    "Please send me the updated project report."
]

for e in emails:
    print(check_email(e))
